# PDF Generator
This code is creating a PDF document using data from a CSV file. It reads in data from the CSV using the Pandas library and creates a new page for each row, setting the header and footer of the page with information from the row. It also creates lines on each page using a while loop. The final output is saved as "output.pdf".
